# Code Repository for GoNotes
GoNotes is a chrome extension independently developed by Hannah Salameh as a way for users to easily take notes.
## Downloading the extension
As of now, this application **only** works on google chrome, so make sure you are using Chrome.

Then navigate to `https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions` and search GoNotes to find the application.

## How to use the application
Press Ctrl + Shift + E to open GoNotes on windows. On mac, Command + Shift + E works instead.

This will open a small window that allows you to take notes! These notes are saved in the new tab.

## Bug Info
Currently, it is only possible to write two notes. This will be fixed in the next update.

Also, it is not possible to intentionally delete notes. Unintentionally deleting notes, though, is extremely easy. Both of these bugs will be patched soon.
